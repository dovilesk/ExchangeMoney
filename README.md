# ExchangeMoney

The problem domain is a FX Exchange, where an amount in one currency is exchanged to another amount in another currency. This is commonly done using an ISO currency pair, e.g. EUR/DKK, where EUR is the main currency and DKK is money currency. Each currency pair is associated with an exchange rate, where 1 of the main currency can be exchanged to given amount in the money currency. For instance: EUR/DKK 7,4394, would denote that 1 EUR can be exchange with 7,4394 DKK.
